# GAN-for-CVD
Color vision deficiency(CVD) is a form of color blindness where the patients are unable to perceive certain color.
There are three forms of color blindness. The data sets for CVD are very limited.
This project involves creation of a data set for CVD and setting up 2-3 GAN's for recoloring images for the colorblind in an optimized manner.
Optimization function would involve identification of the confusion colors, identification of the replacement color and color compensation in optimized time.
